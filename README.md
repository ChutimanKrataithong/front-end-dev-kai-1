# Front End Development

ü§ù How to Contribute:

Go through the CONTRIBUTING.md file, where all the guidelines have been mentioned that will guide you to make your contribution. The project follows a standard fork-and-pull model for contributions via GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Fork the Repository: Start by forking the main project repository to your GitHub account.
Clone the Repository: Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine.
Set Up the Project: Follow the setup instructions to get the project running locally.
Create a Branch: Create a new branch for each issue you work on. This keeps your work organized and prevents conflicts.
Make Changes: Implement your feature or bug fix on the branch you created.
Commit and Push Changes: Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful commit message, and push the branch to your forked repository.
Submit a Pull Request: From your repository, submit a pull request to the main repository. In the PR description, include a detailed explanation of your changes and link the PR to the corresponding issue in the main repository.
